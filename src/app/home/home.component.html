  <h1>Welcome to Github</h1>
  <p>GitHub (originally known as Logical Awesome LLC)[3] is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of
    Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.[4] GitHub offers plans for both private repositories and free
    accounts[5] which are commonly used to host open-source software projects.[6] As of April 2017, GitHub reports having almost 20 million users and 57 million repositories,[7] making it the largest host of source code in the world.</p>
